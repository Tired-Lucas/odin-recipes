        <li>Mix the yeast to a smooth paste with approximately 50 ml lukewarm milk. Put the flour into a bowl, make a well in the centre and pour the yeast mixture into itl. Cover and put in a warm place for about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, drop the tomatoes into boiling water for a few seconds, then skin, quarter, deseed and dice. Then add the remaining warm milk, salt, sugar and olive oil to the yeast mixture and knead to a smooth, springy dough using the dough hook of your mixer. Cover and put in a warm place to rise for about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li> Put 1 tbsp oil into a hot pan.</li>
        <li>Peel and finely chop the garlic and sweat in the oil until soft. </li>
        <li>Add the tomatoes and sweat briefly. Stir in the thyme and simmer for about 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. </li>
        <li>Shred the basil and add to the tomatoes. Remove from the heat. </li>
        <li>Take the dough out of the bowl, knock back (knead again) on a floured surface and cut into four pieces. </li>
        <li>Knead each piece of dough and roll out to a circle the size of the pizza pan. </li>
        <li>Oil each pan and put one pizza base in each, forming a rim at the edge.</li>
        <li>Brush the dough with oil and spread with tomato sauce. Slice the mozzarella and place on top of the tomatoes. Drizzle with a little oil. Bake in a preheated oven (220Â°C) for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown. </li>
